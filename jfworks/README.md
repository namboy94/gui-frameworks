# GFWorks

Gfworks offers python developers a simple way to implement a GUI in different graphical frameworks like Gtk or Tkinter
with a single implementation. This framework is very much a work in progress and the class and method calls are
subject to change.

## Using a template

To use a template, you will need to create a class that inherits from one of the implemented templates.

This class needs to override the __init__ method while also calling the super().__init__ method.

Furthermore, the lay_out method needs to be implemented to add widgets and other UI elements to the GUI.

## Installation

The project has its own [python packaging index site](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gfworks),
and it's possible to install it using ```pip install gfworks``` or ```pip install gfworks --user```
if you do not have admin/root rights.

## Contributing

This project is automatically mirrored to [github](https://github.com/namboy94/gfworks), however all development
is conducted at a privately hosted [Gitlab instance](http://gitlab.namibsun.net/namboy94/gfworks). Issues
on both services are taken unto consideration.

## Documentation

Sphinx Documentation can be found [here](http://krumreyh.eu/gfworks/documentation/html/index.html).
