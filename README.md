This repository contains two projects, gfworks and jfworks, which were
supposed to be GUI-framework-agnostic GUI-frameworks. Which would mean you
could use the same code to target different GUI-frameworks like GTK or Tk.

Since I mostly use QT these days, the project has kind of ended.

gfworks is a framework for python, jfworks for java.
