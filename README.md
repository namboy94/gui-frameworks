# GFWorks

Gfworks offers python developers a simple way to implement a GUI in different graphical frameworks like Gtk or Tkinter
with a single implementation. This framework is very much a work in progress and the class and method calls are
subject to change.

## Using a template

To use a template, you will need to create a class that inherits from one of the implemented templates.

This class needs to override the __init__ method while also calling the super().__init__ method.

Furthermore, the lay_out method needs to be implemented to add widgets and other UI elements to the GUI.
